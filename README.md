# Ai_problem_s
This project implements the A* (A-Star) search algorithm to find the optimal path from a start node to a goal node in a weighted graph with heuristic estimates. The graph is represented using a dictionary with adjacency and heuristic values. Each node contains information about its cumulative cost (g) and heuristic estimate (h). The algorithm prioritizes paths with the lowest estimated total cost (f = g + h) using a priority queue. This implementation solves the problem of efficiently navigating from a source (S) to a destination (G) while minimizing the total path cost, making it suitable for applications in AI planning, routing, and search optimization.
